In the industrial field, the costs associated with equipment's maintenace still represents a large
portion of the resources available to a company. Therefore, new researches in maintenance systems,
and the correct task planning, are growing, since they impact directly on the economic side of the
companies. Thus, current work presents an service-oriented architecture for maintenance systems
integration. The proposed architecture intends to facilitate the integration of equipments and
degradation analysis tools. The architecture is comprised of several entities, where each one is
responsible for executing a given task in order to keep the system running properly. In this work,
all the entities are implemented and experiments are performed in order to validate the proposed
system.
